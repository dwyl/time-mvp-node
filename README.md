# Time MVP

> The scrappiest version possible of [Time](https://github.com/dwyl/time)
written in the crappiest language in the shortest amount of time
to get something working fast so I can start iterating/testing it on myself!
AKA "one to throw away"!

## Why?

To get _something_ I can start using _myself_.

> This code is not written for anyone `else` so please don't "_judge_" it!

## What?

The Time application written in JavaScript/Node.js
without any "_frameworks_" just to get something working
as fast as possible!

## How?

The code in this project/MVP is meant to be: (_in order of priority_)
+ _**Functional** _
+ _**Human-readable** so **anyone** with basic HTML/JavaScript knowledge
can read and **understand*** it_.

We are _not_ making _any_ attempt to make the code:
"_High Performance_", "_Scalable_" or "_Elegant_" in _any_ way.
We consider the MVP to be "_quick_" but _not_ "_dirty_".
